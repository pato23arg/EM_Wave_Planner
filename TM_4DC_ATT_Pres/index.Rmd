# Traffic Matrix Estimation
## TM applied to a managed DC
### Patricio Villar

--- 

## Introduction
<hr>

> * A traffic matrix is a tool used by network architects for network management and capacity planning.
> * Taken together with network topology, routing and fault data; the TM can provide a great deal of help in the diagnosis and management of network congestion.
> * On longer scales, traffic matrices are critical inputs to network design, capacity planning and business planning.

---

## What does a TM provide?
<hr>

### "For every ingress point i into the network and egress point j out of the 

### network, the volume oftraffic T(i,j) from i to j over a time interval."

---

## Methods to Effectively Compute TMs
<hr>
> * Gravity Models
> * Generalized Gravity Models
> * Tomo-Gravity Models

---

## Tomogravity explained
<hr>

> * "Tomo-gravity" = tomography + gravity modeling
> * Exploits topological equivalence to restrict problem size
> * Use of least squares to get the solution:

## Tomogravity Model Applied
<hr>
> * In gral, there are not enough constraints: O(N) vs. O(N^2)
> * Constraints give a subspace of possible solutions
> * Constraints sub-space: Y = A * x + e; where x is the estimated TM
> * Finds a solution that satisfies the constraint AND is close to the Gravity model (Kullback-Lieber distance)
> * Orders of residuals "e" around 0.1. Tested in the Internet2 Abilene network.

## Where do we get Y?
<hr>

> * VPR scheduled reports can provide link loads!!!

---

## Data Tyding:
<hr>
> * VPR data must be rolled up.
> * In general, it provides tidy data. There are some exceptions though.
> * good deck on tidy data on http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~nfultz/tidy.html - Neal Futz (UCLA)

## Create a simple model of your network:
<hr>

```{r echo = F}
library(igraph)
g <- graph.formula(CORE++SA,CORE++WAN,CORE++DCI,CORE++DMZ,CORE++INET,CORE++VPN)
plot(g, vertex.size=40, vertex.color="grey", vertex.label.color="black")
```
